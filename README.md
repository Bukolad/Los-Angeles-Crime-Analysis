# Los-Angeles-Crime-Analysis
This project presents a detailed analysis of crime incidents reported  by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) from 2020 to 2025. The data used for this project was sourced from Kaggle with over a million crimes . The goal is to uncover patterns, track crime trends, and provide actionable insights.
# Project Background
Los-Angeles Police Department(LAPD) was established in 1869, LAPD is the primary law enforcement agency serving nearly 4 million residents across 21 areas in Los-Angeles. With a mission to protect and serve, LAPD works to prevent crime, enforce laws, and ensure public safety in one of the most dynamic cities in the world.

 # Tools and Technologies used
1. Power BI : This was the major tool used for this project. Power BI was used to create interactive dashboards and visualization for the insights generated from this project.
2. Power Query Editor : The Power Query Editor was used for data cleaning and transformation across different columns such as removind duplicates, replacing values, etc

# Project Workflow
A Project Workflow provides structure for every data analytics project. It helps establish a clear roadmap of sequentials steps, from defining the initial probelm to delivering final insights. This keep the projects oragnized, aligned with goals, and ensure no critical steps are overlooked.

# Project Objective
The objectives of this project was to analyze crime trends in Los-Angeles between 2020 and 2025 and provide actionable insights . From this project, it will be easy to understand crime pattern, identify high-crime areas, analyze victim demographics, and tell a data-driven story about the state of crime in Los-Angeles, helping law enforcement agancies, policymakers, and the public make informed decisions.

# Data Collection 
The data for this project was collected from kaggle. The data included crime records from various area in Los-Angeles. 

# Data Cleaning & Preparation
The data cleaning process began in the Power Query Editor in Power BI. The major operation included 
- Removal of duplicates. 
- Text operations such as capitalising each words and replacing values were also carried out on some columns. The M Query Codes from the Power Query Editor have been attached to this repository.
After data cleaning, for easily analysis i added a custom column to group victim's age for easy understanding. In addition, i created new measures and new columns to provide deeper insights into crime trends :
- Average victim age : To profile age trends across crimes
- Blank measure for month and year : to
- Condition formatting growth : This measure was created to highlight month and year growth. if the growth is positive(increase in crime), it shows in red. if negative(crime reduced), it shows in green.
- Crimes last year and this year : This measure was created to compare crime counts across years.
- Max Crime Year : To identify which year recorded the highest crime rate.
- Total Crimes : To calculate the total crimes from 2020-2025.
- Percentage increase in Crime : To calculate the increase in crime each year
- Year Growth : Change in crime volume each year
  
Additonal Transformation included
- Created new Column to calculate Report Days( the difference between Date Reported and Date Occurred)
- New Column was created to group the Report Days for easy analysis
- New Column was creatd to calculate the Time Range and Victim's Age Group.
A Calendar Table was created to support year growth comparisons

# Data Model
The Data Model was automatically created in Power BI. This shows the relationship between the various table in this project.

# Data Analysis & Visualization 
After the completion of data cleaning and preparation, i proceeded to begin my analysis and visualization. To ensure easy readability and understanding,i divided the visualization into 5 dashboards. These dashboards were used to effectively visualize key insights from this analysis.

Some key insights from the data visualization are summarized below:

- ## Victim's Demographics
The victim demographics analysis shows that male victims are the most affected group, accounting for 40.18% of reported crimes in Los Angeles between 2020 and 2025. Female victims make up 35.67% of cases, while incidents where the victimâ€™s gender was not recorded account for 24.14%.

When looking at age groups, individuals aged between 35 and 60 years emerged as the most affected, with 327,000 victims reported in this category. This is followed closely by the 0-17 years group, which recorded 295,000 victims, highlighting that both working-age adults and minors are frequently impacted by crime.

- ## Crimes Report
The crime report analysis reveals that the majority of crimes in Los Angeles were reported early, with approximately 769,000 cases recorded within just two days of the incident. However, there were still noticeable delays in reporting, as about 104,000 cases were reported within one week, 73,000 within one month, and 43,000 within six months. A smaller, yet significant portion around 16,000 cases were reported over six months later, indicating potential barriers or delays in crime reporting among certain cases.

When examining the status of these crimes, it is evident that a large case remains unresolved. Over 804,000 cases are currently marked as Investigation Continuing, reflecting the high volume of ongoing cases within LAPDâ€™s records. Other statuses show 109,000 cases categorized as Adult Other, while 87,000 cases resulted in Adult Arrests. Juvenile-related statuses are lower in volume, with 3,000 cases leading to Juvenile Arrests and 2,000 cases listed as Juvenile Other. A small count of 7 cases remain under unknown status.

This presents an opportunity for the Los Angeles Police Department to strengthen its crime reporting systems, encouraging more timely reports and addressing the underlying causes of delayed reporting

# Conclusion
The analysis of crime data in Los Angeles from 2020 to 2025 reveals important patterns in both crime trends and victim profiles. A total of 1.01 million crimes were reported during this period, with incidents peaking in 2022 before showing a sharp decline in the following years. Vehicle theft and simple assault emerged as the most common crimes, while streets and residential dwellings were identified as the primary locations where these crimes took place.

Victim demographics indicate that males and individuals aged between 35 and 60 years were most frequently affected, while Hispanic and Latino communities reported the highest victim counts. Additionally, the analysis shows that most crimes were reported early, within two days of occurrence, but a significant portion still experienced reporting delays. Over 800,000 cases remain under investigation, reflecting the scale of ongoing efforts required by law enforcement agencies.

Overall, the data highlights both the progress made in reducing crime rates in recent years and the areas that still require focused attention. It provides valuable insights for law enforcement, policymakers, and community leaders seeking to further enhance public safety in Los Angeles.

# Recommendation
- ## Focus Crime Reduction Efforts in High-Risk Areas:
Law enforcement agencies should prioritize crime reduction strategies in areas with the highest crime counts specifically Central, 77th Street, Pacific, and Southwest divisions. Increased patrols, community policing, and localized prevention programs in these zones can help sustain the recent decline in crime rates.

- ## Strengthen Vehicle and Street Crime Prevention
With vehicle theft and street crimes topping the list of offenses, there is a need to invest in improved vehicle security technologies and expand street-level surveillance systems. Public awareness campaigns that educate residents on crime prevention measures can also play a crucial role in reducing incidents.

- ## Tailor Victim Support Programs to Most Affected Groups
Victim assistance initiatives should be designed to support the most vulnerable groups particularly working-age adults (35-60 years) and youth (0-17 years). Programs should also include culturally appropriate outreach targeting Hispanic and Latino communities, which recorded the highest victim counts.

- ## Streamline Case Investigations and Reduce Backlog
With over 800,000 cases still under investigation, there is an opportunity to improve case resolution processes. Streamlining investigation workflows and increasing resources dedicated to case closures can help reduce the backlog and deliver quicker justice outcomes.

- ## Encourage Timely Crime Reporting and Address Delays
Efforts should be made to enhance crime reporting mechanisms to ensure incidents are reported promptly. Special attention should be given to addressing cases that are currently delayed by several months, through community education and by removing barriers that prevent timely reporting.
